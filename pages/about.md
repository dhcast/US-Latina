## About the Collection

The authors and titles featured in this digital collection are a digital adaptation of printed books by [Arte PÃºblico Press](https://artepublicopress.com/). Emphasizing women's literature, the digital collection encompasses a diverse range of genres, including fiction, non-fiction, narrative, poetry, dramatic texts, and anthologies. Spanning historical pieces from nineteenth-century authors, activists, publicists, and participants in the Mexican Revolution to contemporary voices, this collection illuminates previously overlooked literary contributions.
